GROUP MANAGEMENT (Cloud interaction):
	- Create a group:
		- Request returns the single use token
		- Makes a firebase entry for the group
	- Delete or leave a group
		- Delete the group entry from the groups table (all groups) and user: group table (which group user is in)
	- Add member:
		- Request for the one-use token from the cloud (Personal Token/Group Token??)
			- Create a QR code from the token on Android (Token gets replaced if somebody joins)
				- User joins the group and the token gets expired.
	
GROUP MANAGEMENT (Logic): TODO => rules, deletion process etc.
	- User IS NOT in a group
		=> Create a group:	
			- Name does not need to be unique
			- Duration, any restrictions to maximum length?

	- User IS in a group
		=> Group status:
			- Add a member:	 
				- Cannot join if already in a group
				- If token expired before reading, notification to the user with the code? (e.g. "Code expired, go back and click 'add' to refresh")
			- Leave (user IS NOT group creator):
				- Remove user from group, remove group field from user
			- Destroy (user IS creator):
				- For all members in group => remove group field
				- Remove group as a whole from database
