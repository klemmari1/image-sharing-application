Group: timestamp

	1) Create variable in group class
	2) Create timestamp upon group creation
	3) Check timestamp when trying to upload image => expired = no request, notification
	4) Periodically check group expiration date from backend => delete groups e.g. at the end of a day

Questions/Problems:
	- After new user creation, crash when trying to enter group creation (user not ready in database?)	
	- Rules for database/storage?
	- Backend security: block user from modifying groups he's not in
	- Prevent user from getting to group status if group expired? (or just block adding members?)
